\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project contains all code needed for offline convolution GUI application to function. It includes methods for processing an IR and input wav file. The goal of reaching a working spectral convolution algorithm by the end of the fall semester was met. The projects current offline convolver GUI application was created as a proof of concept.\
\
Spectral convolution works when wet/dry mix is at 100% wet. This problem will be the rectified next semester. The project must be rebuilt to switch from time domain to frequency domain methods.}
